## Getting Started

This is the third project carried out by me, Itang, Samuel Itang in the Udacity Nanodegree Program and Google Scholarship.

This is a regular Arcade Game just to have fun.
Users will be asked to input player name and input the duration of time they wish to play this classic arcade game in minutes. Users have the option of having a game that is not timed by simply clearing the input for duration to ensure it is blank.

## How to Play

The game requires just the four (4) direction keys, that is, *up, down, left, right*.
Player is expected to move across the enemy field without colliding with any of the bugs to the water field. On crossing, player gains a point and is reset to start position.
If collision occurs, player is reset to start position and 1 point is deleted from player.

Try to beat your highscore in a timed gamed.
